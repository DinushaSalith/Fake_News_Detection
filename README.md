# Fake_News_Detection
 This system will use AI algorithms to predict whether the news is fake. Twitter(X) is also working on this system to make their tweets authenticated and credible. To make this system, download a dataset from Kaggle and apply the machine learning algorithm. You can develop it in Python, but if you want it as a web-based system, create it in Django.
